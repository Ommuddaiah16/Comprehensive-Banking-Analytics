## Domain: Banking

## Problem Statement

1. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering):** Utilize clustering algorithms to group customers based on their banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.

2. **Credit Risk Assessment (Classification):**
   - Develop a robust credit scoring system using classification algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants.
   - Utilize historical data to train the model and predict the likelihood of default or late payments.
   - Enhance risk management by integrating machine learning models into the credit approval process.

## Approach

1. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering):**
   - Utilize clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering to group customers based on similarities in their banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the customer segments.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of different clustering algorithms using appropriate metrics such as silhouette score or Daviesâ€“Bouldin index.

2. **Credit Risk Assessment (Classification):**
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Machines on the training data.
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Select the best-performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
   - Implement the final model in the credit approval process to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants.
